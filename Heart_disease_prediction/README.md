#######Heart Disease Prediction

This repository is dedicated to predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The dataset utilized for analysis encompasses a comprehensive set of clinical attributes, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and several other vital signs.

Motivation:
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the critical need for accurate prediction and early detection. By leveraging machine learning techniques on relevant medical data, this project aims to contribute to the development of effective diagnostic tools and personalized treatment strategies.

Key Features:
Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset's characteristics and distributions using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and trends.
Feature Selection: Employ correlation analysis and heatmap visualization to identify the most influential features and their relationships, aiding in the selection of relevant predictors for the predictive models.
Data Processing: Apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling, categorical variable encoding, and data splitting to prepare the dataset for training and evaluation of machine learning models.
Machine Learning Models: Implement and compare the performance of three widely used classifiers - K Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach.
Dependencies:
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis tasks, including reading and writing datasets.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and line plots to explore data distributions and relationships.
Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization capabilities, including heatmap creation for correlation analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation procedures.
